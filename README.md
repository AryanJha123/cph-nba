Using Cox Proportional Hazards to predict NBA survival.
My methodology can be found in my article (https://medium.com/@aryanjha/figuring-out-why-nba-players-get-injured-using-cox-proportional-hazards-226a717eb55c) or my video (https://youtu.be/fbeqAZnMvKE).

# How to Run
First, run datacollection.ipynb. You can edit the players list to change which players you use to train the model.
Once you've collected the data, run coxproportionalhazards.ipynb. You can run Schoenfeld tests, create Kaplan-Meier plots, and create forest plots using the code already given. Check the lifelines docs if you want to try somethinge else.
